A MadLibs Story Written in Java

This morning Angela woke up feeling energetic. 'It is going to be a great day!' Outside, a bunch of people were protesting to keep Reese's Peanut Butter Cups in stores. They began to chant to the rhythm of the Jailhouse Rock, which made all the store owners very nervous. Concerned, Angela texted Steve, who flew Angela to Iceland and dropped Angela in a puddle of frozen whale blubber. Angela woke up in the year 3033, in a world where Sasquatches ruled the world.
